# React - Portfolio Site Practice

---

- React practice following a YouTube tutorial.

1. [Create React App Tutorial - Portfolio website with React Router v4 and Material design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AboneIxeM8&list=WL&index=13&t=0s)

2. [Create React App Portfolio website Tutorial - Designing the landing page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8iA18R76jk&list=WL&index=8)

**Ellie's note**: Overall a easy-to-follow tutorial! The only thing I don't like is that he used a deprecated npm 'React MDL'. Still working on it at the moment. Will give my final verdict after completion.
