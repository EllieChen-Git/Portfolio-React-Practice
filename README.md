#### Ellie's note:

- **Overall Verdict**: It's an easy-to-follow tutorial! The only thing I don't like is that the author used a deprecated npm 'React MDL'. As he didn't explain much about the code, I didn't learn much about React with this tutorial.
- **Suitable**: People who just start learning React, html & CSS and wish to build a very simple portfolio website.
- **Not suitable**: People who want to learn some intermediate React knowledge. People who want to be build a responsive website.
